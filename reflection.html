												<p>HTML, podcasts, and video editing were totally new to me at the beginning of this course, but I feel that with the knowledge of the basics that we have learned, I have more interest in these subjects, and find myself wanting to know more. I really was not expecting to code complete web pages, but even with knowing the basics, I’ve been able to create some very cool web pages. HTML has been challenging, and it was especially challenging at the beginning of the semester. I had listened to podcasts before, but had no clue how they were created. Now that I know how podcasts are created, and the editing behind it, thwy are much more intriguing. As mentioned on my interests page, I am very interested in sports media, and there are several sports podcasts in the world. Knowing the editing procedures and the process of publishing a podcast will help me in the future when applying to sports media jobs. Video editing has always impressed me, but like the other processes learned in this class, I had no experience. Learning how to use Adobe Premiere Pro in a basic format with my groupmates was a lot of fun for me, and it sparked interest in me to continue to work on my own video editing projects. I enjoyed video editing the most out od the processes learned this semester. </p>
												<p>Coming into this course, I was expecting use templates and other website to automatically put my content on the web. I was not expecting to edit podcasts or video at all. However, learning how to do this manually has been fascinating. While the class certainly focuses on both content and software in this class, I was expecting to focus more on the content in this class. However, there has been a great balance of content and software. To go back to what I said earlier, it is so important to have a handle on both of these things. That’s where my perspective has changed, as now I feel that I am more interested in the coding and editing side of things, as much as I am in the content.</p>
												<p>Lastly, I would like to end on the VT-shaped student. Personally, I enjoyed learning about what this school wants out of its students. I think the concept of the VT-shaped student is great. Before this semester, I was solely focused on writing. Even though I knew I was going to take classes in the future based on technical topics and software, I was not expecting that I would enjoy them. Instead, I was planning on sticking to writing, and only writing. However, that soon changed. Not only have I enjoyed learning to do things like code and edit video, I have also learned just how important it is to know these things AND know how to create great written content. I think the VT-shaped student is a concept that needs to reach beyond communications majors, and into the more technical and science majors. I believe this is a goal that all Virginia Tech students should be striving towards.</p>

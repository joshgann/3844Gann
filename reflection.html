												<p>Module 1 covered a lot of material, and taught me a lot of things. I was introduced to a field and language in which I had no experience in prior to this course. The readings connect past accomplishments in technology, including the first computer, to the current theme at Virginia Tech of the VT-shaped student. This module shows us the innovation and knowledge necessary in the technology field. It showed us how the computer started off as a card-punching calculator, but through lots of work by Eckert and Mauchly, was able to build this automatic machine able to calculate without human intervention. This module then explains the message of the VT-shaped student, which was the most interesting topic to me throughout this module. This motto aims to give students interdisciplinary knowledge by combining technological experience with guided learning and informal communal skills. This idea was brought to Virginia Tech by the new provost, Thanassis Rikakis. The ambitious new provost came into the job with several ideas right out of the gate, but with an emphasis on cross-disciplinary opportunities. I think this idea interests me so much because I have seen both sides of this academia. I entered my freshman year as a chemistry major. I was determined to spend a career working in a laboratory, and saw my freshman year English class as just 3 credit hours to fulfill. However, now being a multimedia journalism has changed. Especially since taking this class, I see the need in this world for both science and the arts. We cannot have fancy, lightning-fast programs without appealing and accurate content. It goes the other way around too. This module was able to emphasize this though, which I really appreciated. </p>
												<p>HTML was totally new to me at the beginning of this course, but I feel that with the knowledge of the basics that we have learned, I have more interest in it, and find myself wanting to know more. One thing I really appreciate about HTML is the shortcuts it provides. As you’re typing out a code in Atom, it often recognizes it and suggests a complete code to complete what you are typing out. I also like how much you can do with HTML. I really was not expecting to code complete web pages, but even with knowing the basics, I’ve been able to create some very cool web pages. It has been challenging to remember the precise order of a typical webpage code, but I’m sure it will become more familiar with practice. It is also frustrating and challenging at times to publish a web page, but I believe that will become more natural as well. </p>
												<p>Coming into this course, I was expecting use templates and other website to automatically put my content on the web. However, learning how to do this manually has been fascinating. While the class certainly focuses on both content and code in this class, I was expecting to focus more on the content in this class. However, it has seemed to be geared toward coding, since this is something most of us have never done before, and I really have enjoyed that. To go back to what I said earlier, it is so important to have a handle on both of these things. That’s where my perspective has changed, as now I feel that I am more interested in the coding and structure, almost as much as I am in the content.</p>

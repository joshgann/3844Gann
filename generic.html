							<p>I am a sophomore studying multimedia journalism and professional and technical writing at Virginia Tech. I have recently gotten involved with the sports branch of Collegiate Times. I have been able to shadow current writers, and contribute to a collaborative article this semester. I am hoping to get more coverage as a writer for the sports staff next semester. Sports is my passion, and I have always enjoyed writing. That is what sparked my interest in multimedia journalism, as well as collegiate times. When I think about my career, I have always envisioned being a beat writer for a sports team. However, after this semester, that thought has changed. While I still want to work in the sports journalism field, I do not feel like I am restricted to only writing. I now have interest in other sports media, such as social media, video, or website design. I have gained experience in so many technological design efforts through this class, and others I have taken throughout this semester, and I have enjoyed these courses a lot.</p>
							<p>I am also involved in Cru, a campus ministry at Virginia Tech. I am very involved in this ministry; I attend a Bible study, and co-lead a Bible study. I have led worship in the past, and I have also gone on two mission trips with this ministry. My faith is something that has grown a great deal throughout my life, and especially since coming to Virginia Tech. It is something that I want to continue to grow in the future, as I have considered working in ministry after college.  </p>
							<p>The VT-shaped student was a foreign concept to me entering this semester. However, it has been solidified in my mine as an extremely relevant concept. To me, it is ironic that I began learning about this concept this semester. Before this semester, I was focused primarily on writing. However, I have taken multiple classes this semester exposing me to technological elements of communications. The VT-shaped student is one who has knowledge and experience in creative processes as well as scientific and technological processes. The VT-shaped student also must be well rounded outside of academics, being involved in community. This semester, I expanded my knowledge past writing and into design programs, and also became more involved in my Cru. I was experiencing the concept of the VT-shaped student while learning about it, which made this semester very unique. </p>

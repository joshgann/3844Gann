								<h1>Creative Design</h1>
								<h2>Horizontal T</h2>
								<p>Invent the future. We Hokies are given this challenge, and expected to accomplish this. We build, experiment, code, engineer and design our future. We innovate. We dream. We achieve greatness. We inspire those that will come after us to continue to build, experiment, code… etc. By this, we will thrive. We are beyond paper and pen, and creative writing. We are the future.</p>
								<h2>Vertical T</h2>
								<p>In the middle of it all
									Is the focus of my studies.
									The English language
									rules reasoning as we invent the future.
									To invent the future,
									we must recall the past
									to articulate design
									and give deeper meaning.</p>
									<h2> Left V</h2>
									<p>Co-ops.
										Research.
										Internships.
										Study abroad.
										Join this organization.
										Serve the community.
										Organization leadership.
										The world is looking
										for well-rounded workers
										and with these qualities
										you can be
										the perfect candidate.</p>
									<h2>Right V</h2>
									<p>I would have never thought
										that I would be coding.
										HTML, podcasts and video
										have redefined my view
										of digital media.
										Text, audio, and video,
										and their intricate complexities,
										have truly shown me
										writing and digital media together.</p>

						<a href="VT poem.docx">VT-shaped poem.</a>
						<p>For my creative design, I decided to write a poem based on my experience with the VT-shaped student, and with digital media this semester. When approaching writing this poem, I wanted to make this more than just a poem. The concept of writing a poem in the shape of VT came to mind, to visually represent what I have been learning this semester. While this is one poem, it is a combination of four poems into one. Each text box represents a different part of the VT-shaped student.</p>
						<p>The poem for the horizontal part of the T is about how Virginia Tech students invent the future. It primarily focuses on the technical studies at Virginia Tech, and how they are paving the way for the future.</p>
						<p>The left side of the V is a poem about communal learning. The importance of extending one's learning beyond learning. Internships, co-ops and research opportunities not only look good on resumes, but they also make for easy connections. They can make the search for a career much easier.</p>
						<p> The right side of the V is a poem about my experience in writing and digital media this semester. This is the most personal of the four poems, as it is restricted to my experience alone. It explains how the subjects that were taught in this class this semester really changed my perspective of digital media but also of my academic experience in college.</p>
						<p> The vertical part of the T is about my focus of study, being the English language. Even though we need innovators and designers to break ground in future endeavors, writing still holds value. We need writers to relay information to the public. We need the public to be able to grasp new inventions, and we need writers to be able to make this information comprehensible. Employers everywhere need writers as much as they need innovators, and having someone who can do both is invaluable.
						<p> The person that puts all of these qualities together is more equipped for the future than many. The VT-shaped student as a concept should be the goal that all Virginia Tech students are striving for: to be experienced in all areas of education. </p>

								<p>“technology alone is not enough—it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”</p>
								<p>- Steve Jobs; <a href="http://liberalarts.vt.edu/about/vt-shaped_learner.html">College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences</a></p>
								<p>“What important problem can be solved only by engineers who are trained only in engineering, or by poets who have mastered only poetry?”</p>
								<p>-Timothy Sands; <a href="http://liberalarts.vt.edu/about/vt-shaped_learner.html">College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences</a></p>
								<p>"Computing after 1945 is a story of people who at critical moments redeﬁned the nature of the technology itself. In doing so they opened up computing to new markets, new applications, and a new place in the social order."</p>
								<p>This quote from<a href="file:///C:/Users/gannt/AppData/Local/Temp/9780262532037_sch_0001.pdf">The Advent of Commercial Computing</a> shows us how the first two quotes applied to early computing. These early scientists had to be innovate as a group in order to redefine the nature of technology.</p>
								<p>"Scientists build upon the work of other scientists without asking or paying for the privilege."</p>
								<p>	<a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/freeculture.pdf">Free Culture</a></p>
								<p>	"It was in the midst of building this machine that its creators conceived of an alternative. It was too late to incorporate that insight into the ENIAC, but it did form the basis for a proposed follow-on machine called the ‘‘EDVAC’’ (Electronic Discrete Variable Computer)".</p>
								<p>This quote from <a href="file:///C:/Users/gannt/AppData/Local/Temp/9780262532037_sch_0001.pdf">The Advent of Commercial Computing</a> shows us how scientists of these early scientists applied the previous quote to their work, using each other's work and research to improve their technology.</p>
								<p>	"Creators here and everywhere are always and at all times building upon the creativity that went before and that surrounds them now."
								<p>	<a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/freeculture.pdf">Free Culture</a></p>
								<p>"Rikakis brought his experience with the excitement. From his time as a professor of arts, media and engineering at Arizona State University, beginning in the early 2000s, he was passionate about creating cross-disciplinary projects."</p>
								<p>This quote from <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/education/higher_education/virginia_tech/virginia-tech-s-provost-orchestrating">Roanoke Times</a> shows how the new Virginia Tech provost applied the previous quote to his career at Virginia Tech.</p>
								<p>	"Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual."
								<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">The Atlantic</a></p>
								<p>	"Both the assembling and the distribution of knowledge in the world at present are extremely ineffective and thinkers of the forward-looking type whose ideas we are now considering, are beginning to realize that the most hopeful line for the development our racial intelligence lies rather in the direction of creating a new world organ…"</p>
								<p>This quote from <a href="file:///C:/Users/gannt/AppData/Local/Temp/Wells_ContributionToEncyclopedie.pdf">World Brain</a> shows us that H.G. wells prediction of the world needin to think more scientifically in order to preogress towards a permanent world encyclopedia alligns with the previous quote.</p>
								<p>"The capital T is the cross between a student’s disciplinary depth and transdisciplinary knowledge and technological experience. The V connects those traits through informal communal and guided experiential learning.The VT-shaped graduate will be well-rounded, both hirable and ready to serve the community, Rikakis said."</p>
								<p><a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/education/higher_education/virginia_tech/virginia-tech-s-provost-orchestrating">Roanoke Times</a> gives us the concept of the VT-shaped student, which is the over-arching theme of this module.</p>

								<p>The T-shaped podcast tells a story of a freshman engineer whose only purpose in school seems to be engineering. He insults communications majors several times throughout the podcast, and uplifts the school of engineering, placing it far above the liberal art education in his mind. He doesn't see the need to expand knowledge beyond the scientific side. The "t" of the VT-shaped student is all about being balanced in the creative side of academics, and the scientific and technological side. As a communications major, I have learned the importance of being well grounded in both of these areas. I have seen my writing skills improve, but also have gained this new knowledge in things like editing and design. The freshman in this podcast leans on his understanding of engineering and mathematics, but soon realizes the importance of being equipped in writing. Employers want candidates with various skills, and the T-shaped student should have the necessary attributes employers want, being creatively and technically skilled. </p>
